Each user role has access to relevant project data, with automated monthly progress reports and daily deadline reminders sent via email. The backend is built with Django REST Framework, using MySQL for data storage, and deployed on an Ubuntu server. Celery is used to schedule background tasks like report generation and email notifications.</p>
