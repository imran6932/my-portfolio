            Leasing Scraper : Car Leasing Price Tracking Web App
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 project-description">
            The Leasing Scraper is a powerful web application developed for a
            client to monitor car leasing prices, both for their own fleet and
            for their competitors. The app scrapes detailed data from
            leasing.com on a daily basis, ensuring up-to-date pricing
            information is available at all times. Users can create watchlists
            of specific cars, track their price movements, and compare these
            cars using graphical visualizations. Additionally, the platform
            allows users to filter and compare cars based on leasing terms,
            companies, derivatives, and other criteria. The app sends daily
            summary emails and offers an intuitive dashboard for detailed
            analysis. The backend is built using Django REST Framework, data is
            scraped using Scrapy, and PostgreSQL is used for data storage, with
            Celery scheduling the scraper and handling email notifications.
